🔑 A Note on Data & Accuracy
This project uses public stock market APIs and machine learning models trained on historical data.
Predictions are for educational and research purposes only — not financial advice.
The accuracy depends on available historical data and market volatility.
For best performance, you can integrate your own API key (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.) in the .env file.

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend	- Html, JavaScript
Styling - 	CSS, Chart.js 
Backend / AI -	Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Data Source	Yahoo Finance API / Alpha Vantage API
Hosting	- Vercel
Build Tools	- streamlit, Python pip
Deployment -	GitHub + Vercel 

🚧 Challenges Faced
API Limitations: Free stock APIs often have request limits and occasional delays. Implemented caching and error handling to avoid app crashes.
Model Accuracy: Stock markets are highly volatile — needed to experiment with different ML algorithms (LSTM, Linear Regression, Prophet) to improve predictions.
Data Formatting: Cleaning and preparing large CSV datasets for training without losing crucial features was tricky.
Responsive UI: Ensuring charts and tables work smoothly on mobile devices required custom CSS tweaks.
Backend Deployment: Deploying Python ML models to cloud hosting without breaking dependencies took some trial and error.

📚 What I Learned
How to integrate real-time financial APIs into a web app
Techniques for time series forecasting in Machine Learning
Best practices for data preprocessing and handling missing values
How to deploy Python AI models and connect them with a React frontend
Importance of UI clarity in financial applications

⏳ Development Time: Around 15 days from concept to deployment — including ML model building, API integration, UI/UX polishing, and testing.
